Newly designed account management system based on latest gems and plugins.

Goals:
  - use authlogic gem to handle session authentication
  - support multiple OpenID identities (from embark project, idselector.com support and recaptcha gem)
  - support decryption of user passwords (from insoshi project)
  - role-based authorization (role_requirement gem)
  - administrative interface (from baseapp project)
  - yaml configuration (configatron gem)
  - use DRY form builders (awesome_fields and better_partials gems)
  - improved outgoing and incoming mail handling and background tasks 
  - seo-friendly URLs (friendly_id and static_actions gems; not yet 
included)
  - thor task system (from blank project; not yet included)
  - jquery support (from blank project; not yet included)
(simplified_starling, tlsmail, fetcher gems)

Built against Rails 2.2.1 (in vendor/rails).
